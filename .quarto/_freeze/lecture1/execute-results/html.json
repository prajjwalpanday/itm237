In Jupyter Notebook, we will run these in a 'cell'.\n\n### Print Function\n\nWe can also force the output of a value by using the **print** function. The simples for would look like this.\n\n    print(<expression>)\n\nYou can also write a **print** function that includes two or more expressions separated by commas.\n\n    print(<expression>, ..., <expression>)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#statements are interpreted one by one\nprint (\"Hello World\")\nprint (\"something else\")\nprint (\"2+2\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello World\nsomething else\n2+2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#Here are some escape sequences\na = \"Hello\\aFUGU\\aSHRIMP\"\nb = 'Hello\\tFUGU\\nSHRIMP' #single quotes work as well \nprint (a,b)\n\n#why do you think the output is like this?\n#try taking the escape sequences to find out\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello\u0007FUGU\u0007SHRIMP Hello\tFUGU\nSHRIMP\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
