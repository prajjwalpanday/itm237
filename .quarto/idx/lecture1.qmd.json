In Jupyter Notebook, we will run these in a 'cell'.\n\n### Print Function\n\nWe can also force the output of a value by using the **print** function. The simples for would look like this.\n\n    print(<expression>)\n\nYou can also write a **print** function that includes two or more expressions separated by commas.\n\n    print(<expression>, ..., <expression>)\n\n```{python}\n#statements are interpreted one by one\nprint (\"Hello World\")\nprint (\"something else\")\nprint (\"2+2\")\n```\n\n```{python}\n#Here are some escape sequences\na = \"Hello\\aFUGU\\aSHRIMP\"\nb = 'Hello\\tFUGU\\nSHRIMP' #single quotes work as well \nprint (a,b)\n\n#why do you think the output is like this?\n#try taking the escape sequences to find out\n\n\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"highlight-style":"tango","output-file":"lecture1.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"flatly","code-copy":true,"title":"Lecture 1"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
