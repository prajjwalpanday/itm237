In Jupyter Notebook, we will run these in a 'cell'.\n\n\n### Print Function\n\nWe can also force the output of a value by using the **print** function. The simples for would look like this.  \n    \n    print(<expression>)\nYou can also write a **print** function that includes two or more expressions separated by commas. \n    \n    print(<expression>, ..., <expression>)\n    \n\n\n### Commenting in Python\nYou can add comment to your python scripts with the # symbol. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result.\n\n\n\n### Basic mathematical operations\nPython supports all of the mathematical operations you would expect. For additional resources, please see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math\n\n### Input Function\nThe **input** function displays a prompt for the input. For example, the prompt can be \n\n    name = input(\"Enter your name.  :\")\n    \nThe text in parentheses (\"Enter your name.  :\") is an **argument** for the **input** function that tells it what to do for the promt. The string returned by the function in our example is saved by assigning it to the variable **name**.\nA **variable** is just a name for a value and the value can be called up through the variable name. To create a variable, use =. In Python, = means assignment, not equality. If the user enters the name \"Prajjwal Panday\", the value of the variable name can be viewed as follows:\n\n    print(name)\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n   \n     \n\n\n#### Quiz 1 \nPlease finish these five questions.\n\nQ1. Print the sum of 7 and 10 and add the comment 'Addition' \n\nQ2. Create variables for each and solve the following using operators. Print out the final result as a separate variable.\n\n1. 6 + 4\n\n2. ((27 * 2) + 46) ** 0.5\n\nQ3. Using your own height (in meters) and weight (kilograms), please compute your individual BMIs. Create a variable called BMI to store the output. \nBMI is calculated as weight / (height)^2 where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.\n\nQ4. Print your name and address as strings in different variables and print them together using print() function\n \n\nQ5. Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100 x 1.1 dollars, and after two years it's 100 X 1.1. X 1.1. Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 10 years, and print the result.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"highlight-style":"tango","output-file":"code_1.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"flatly","code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
