Install Python and Virtualenv","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nAdapted from [Source](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/360023654474-Installing-and-Configuring-Python-with-RStudio)\n\nEnsure that your installation of Python has the virtualenv package installed by running: \n```\npip install virtualenv\n```\n\n#### Step 2. Create a Python environment in your project\nIt is recommended that you use one virtual environment per project, similar to how packrat is used to manage R packages within a project.\nNavigate into your RStudio project directory by using the following command:\n```\ncd <project-dir>\n```\nCreate a new virtual environment in a folder called my_env within your project directory using the following command:\n```\nvirtualenv quarto_env\n\n```\n\n#### Step 3. Activate your Python environment\nYou can activate the virtualenv in your project using the following command in a terminal:\n```\nsource my_env/bin/activate\n```\nYou can verify that you have activated the correct version of Python using the following command in a terminal:\n```\nwhich python\n```\n#### Step 4. Install Python packages in your environment\nYou can install Python packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and other packages in your Python virtualenv by using pip install using the following command in a terminal:\n```\npip install numpy pandas matplotlib\n```\n```\npip install jupyter\n```\n#### Step 5. Install and configure reticulate to use your Python version\nInstall and configure reticulate to use your Python version\n```\ninstall.packages(\"reticulate\")\n```\nTo configure reticulate to point to the Python executable in your virtualenv, create a file in your project directory called .Renviron with the following contents:\n```\nRETICULATE_PYTHON=quarto_env/bin/python\n```\nYou'll need to restart your R session for the setting to take effect. You can verify that reticulate is configured for the correct version of Python using the following command in your R console:\n```\nreticulate::py_config()\n```\n\n#### Step 6. Publish a project to RStudio Connect\nCreate a markdown file with a title and source. You can then render your quarto markdown file to publish file.\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Lecture 2\"\njupyter: python3\n\n---\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"highlight-style":"tango","output-file":"publish.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"flatly","code-copy":true,"title":"Publishing Python from Rstudio using Quarto"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
