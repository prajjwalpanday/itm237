    "text": "Welcome\nCourse Summary:\n\nThis course is an introduction to the Python programming language for students. Python is a language with a simple syntax and a powerful set of libraries. We cover data types, loops, strings, lists, methods, graphics, and GUI interfaces. Time permitting, we will discuss tools for data analysis. In-class instruction will focus on case studies tackling business applications. The objective is to help students learn to use Python to solve problems and analyze data.\nAt the end of the semester, the students are expected:\n\n\nTo be able to design Python programs\n\n\nTo be able to analyze data with Python, and\n\n\nTo develop a toolbox of problem-solving strategies, identify, and execute them."

Note: The underlying JavaScript will not be updated by this process, so a refresh of the browser after clearing the output and saving is necessary to clear everything fully.\n\nimport matplotlib\nreload(matplotlib)\n\nmatplotlib.use('nbagg')\n\nimport matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg\nreload(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg)\n\n\nUAT 1 - Simple figure creation using pyplot\nShould produce a figure window which is interactive with the pan and zoom buttons. (Do not press the close button, but any others may be used).\n\nimport matplotlib.backends.backend_webagg_core\nreload(matplotlib.backends.backend_webagg_core)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.interactive(False)\n\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nplt.plot(range(10))\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 2 - Creation of another figure, without the need to do plt.figure.\nAs above, a new figure should be created.\n\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 3 - Connection info\nThe printout should show that there are two figures which have active CommSockets, and no figures pending show.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\n\n\nUAT 4 - Closing figures\nClosing a specific figure instance should turn the figure into a plain image - the UI should have been removed. In this case, scroll back to the first figure and assert this is the case.\n\nplt.close(fig1)\nplt.close('all')\n\n\n\nUAT 5 - No show without plt.show in non-interactive mode\nSimply doing a plt.plot should not show a new figure, nor indeed update an existing one (easily verified in UAT 6). The output should simply be a list of Line2D instances.\n\nplt.plot(range(10))\n\n\n\nUAT 6 - Connection information\nWe just created a new figure, but didn’t show it. Connection info should no longer have “Figure 1” (as we closed it in UAT 4) and should have figure 2 and 3, with Figure 3 without any connections. There should be 1 figure pending.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\n\n\nUAT 7 - Show of previously created figure\nWe should be able to show a figure we’ve previously created. The following should produce two figure windows.\n\nplt.show()\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 8 - Interactive mode\nIn interactive mode, creating a line should result in a figure being shown.\n\nplt.interactive(True)\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nSubsequent lines should be added to the existing figure, rather than creating a new one.\n\nplt.plot(range(3))\n\nCalling connection_info in interactive mode should not show any pending figures.\n\nprint(matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg.connection_info())\n\nDisable interactive mode again.\n\nplt.interactive(False)\n\n\n\nUAT 9 - Multiple shows\nUnlike most of the other matplotlib backends, we may want to see a figure multiple times (with or without synchronisation between the views, though the former is not yet implemented). Assert that plt.gcf().canvas.manager.reshow() results in another figure window which is synchronised upon pan & zoom.\n\nplt.gcf().canvas.manager.reshow()\n\n\n\nUAT 10 - Saving notebook\nSaving the notebook (with CTRL+S or File->Save) should result in the saved notebook having static versions of the figures embedded within. The image should be the last update from user interaction and interactive plotting. (check by converting with ipython nbconvert <notebook>)\n\n\nUAT 11 - Creation of a new figure on second show\nCreate a figure, show it, then create a new axes and show it. The result should be a new figure.\nBUG: Sometimes this doesn’t work - not sure why (@pelson).\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nplt.axes()\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 12 - OO interface\nShould produce a new figure and plot it.\n\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_nbagg import new_figure_manager,show\n\nmanager = new_figure_manager(1000)\nfig = manager.canvas.figure\nax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax.plot([1,2,3])\nfig.show()"

    "section": "UAT 13 - Animation",
    "text": "UAT 13 - Animation\nThe following should generate an animated line:\n\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nimport numpy as np\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nx = np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 0.01)        # x-array\nline, = ax.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n\ndef animate(i):\n    line.set_ydata(np.sin(x+i/10.0))  # update the data\n    return line,\n\n#Init only required for blitting to give a clean slate.\ndef init():\n    line.set_ydata(np.ma.array(x, mask=True))\n    return line,\n\nani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, np.arange(1, 200), init_func=init,\n                              interval=100., blit=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\nUAT 14 - Keyboard shortcuts in IPython after close of figure\nAfter closing the previous figure (with the close button above the figure) the IPython keyboard shortcuts should still function.\n\n\nUAT 15 - Figure face colours\nThe nbagg honours all colours apart from that of the figure.patch. The two plots below should produce a figure with a red background. There should be no yellow figure.\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams.update({'figure.facecolor': 'red',\n                            'savefig.facecolor': 'yellow'})\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 16 - Events\nPressing any keyboard key or mouse button (or scrolling) should cycle the line while the figure has focus. The figure should have focus by default when it is created and re-gain it by clicking on the canvas. Clicking anywhere outside of the figure should release focus, but moving the mouse out of the figure should not release focus.\n\nimport itertools\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nx = np.linspace(0,10,10000)\ny = np.sin(x)\nln, = ax.plot(x,y)\nevt = []\ncolors = iter(itertools.cycle(['r', 'g', 'b', 'k', 'c']))\ndef on_event(event):\n    if event.name.startswith('key'):\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.key))\n    elif event.name == 'scroll_event':\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.step))\n    else:\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.button))\n    evt.append(event)\n    ln.set_color(next(colors))\n    fig.canvas.draw()\n    fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_release_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('scroll_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_release_event', on_event)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 17 - Timers\nSingle-shot timers follow a completely different code path in the nbagg backend than regular timers (such as those used in the animation example above.) The next set of tests ensures that both “regular” and “single-shot” timers work properly.\nThe following should show a simple clock that updates twice a second:\n\nimport time\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\n\ndef update(text):\n    text.set(text=time.ctime())\n    text.axes.figure.canvas.draw()\n    \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\ntimer.start()\nplt.show()\n\nHowever, the following should only update once and then stop:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center') \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\n\nplt.show()\n\nAnd the next two examples should never show any visible text at all:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 18 - stopping figure when removed from DOM\nWhen the div that contains from the figure is removed from the DOM the figure should shut down it’s comm, and if the python-side figure has no more active comms, it should destroy the figure. Repeatedly running the cell below should always have the same figure number\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\nRunning the cell below will re-show the figure. After this, re-running the cell above should result in a new figure number.\n\nfig.canvas.manager.reshow()\n\n\n\nUAT 19 - Blitting\nClicking on the figure should plot a green horizontal line moving up the axes.\n\nimport itertools\n\ncnt = itertools.count()\nbg = None\n\ndef onclick_handle(event):\n    \"\"\"Should draw elevating green line on each mouse click\"\"\"\n    global bg\n    if bg is None:\n        bg = ax.figure.canvas.copy_from_bbox(ax.bbox) \n    ax.figure.canvas.restore_region(bg)\n\n    cur_y = (next(cnt) % 10) * 0.1\n    ln.set_ydata([cur_y, cur_y])\n    ax.draw_artist(ln)\n    ax.figure.canvas.blit(ax.bbox)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'r')\nln, = ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 0], 'g', animated=True)\nplt.show()\nax.figure.canvas.draw()\n\nax.figure.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick_handle)"

In Jupyter Notebook, we will run these in a ‘cell’.\n\n\n\nWe can also force the output of a value by using the print function. The simples for would look like this.\nprint(<expression>)\nYou can also write a print function that includes two or more expressions separated by commas.\nprint(<expression>, ..., <expression>)\n\n#statements are interpreted one by one\nprint (\"Hello World\")\nprint (\"something else\")\nprint (\"2+2\")\n\n\n## There is a help system\n\n\n## Type an expression in this code block and run it\nbin(150)\n\n\nprint (\"Hello World\")\n\n\nname = \"Prajjwal Panday\"\n\"Hello there, \" + name\n\n\nround(18.96)\n\n\n#Here are some escape sequences\na = \"Hello\\aFUGU\\aSHRIMP\"\nb = 'Hello\\tFUGU\\nSHRIMP' #single quotes work as well \nprint (a,b)\n\n#why do you think the output is like this?\n#try taking the escape sequences to find out\n\n\n\n\nYou can add comment to your python scripts with the # symbol. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result.\n\n\n\nPython supports all of the mathematical operations you would expect. For additional resources, please see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Basic_Math\n\nmass_kg = int(input(\"What is your mass in kilograms?\" ))\nmass_stone = mass_kg * 2.2 / 14\nprint(\"You weigh\", mass_stone, \"stone.\")\n\n\nprint (round(3.14159265, 2))\n\n\n# Examples of Arithmetic Operator\na = 9\nb = 4\n  \n# Addition of numbers\nadd = a + b\n  \n# Subtraction of numbers\nsub = a - b\n  \n# Multiplication of number\nmul = a * b\n  \n# Division(float) of number\ndiv1 = a / b\n  \n# Division(floor) of number\ndiv2 = a // b\n  \n# Modulo of both number - outputs remainder\nmod = a % b\n  \n# Power\np = a ** b\n  \n# print results\nprint('a + b = ', add)\nprint('a - b = ', sub)\nprint('a * b = ', mul)\nprint('a / b = ',div1)\nprint('a // b = ', div2)\nprint('a % b = ', mod)\nprint('a ** b = ', p)\n\n\n\n\nThe input function displays a prompt for the input. For example, the prompt can be\nname = input(\"Enter your name.  :\")\nThe text in parentheses (“Enter your name. :”) is an argument for the input function that tells it what to do for the promt. The string returned by the function in our example is saved by assigning it to the variable name. A variable is just a name for a value and the value can be called up through the variable name. To create a variable, use =. In Python, = means assignment, not equality. If the user enters the name “Prajjwal Panday”, the value of the variable name can be viewed as follows:\nprint(name)\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name.  :\")\nprint(name)\n\n\nfirst=float(input(\"Tell me the first number: \"))\nsecond=float(input(\"Tell me the second number: \"))\nprint(\"The sum of the two numbers is\", first+second)\nprint(\"The product of the two numbers is\", first*second)\n\n\n\"The raven said 'nevermore,' that's his favorite thing to say\"\n\n\n\"Hello! Here I'm using a single quote.\"\n\n\n# Newline character \\n also knows as escape sequence\n\"This is a very long sentence which extends all the way to next line. There is not break. When you evaluate a string in Python without the print function, \\n is embedded in the result\"\n\n\nprint(\"This is a very long sentence which extends all the way to next line. There is no break. When you evaluate a string in Python without the print function, a space is embedded in the result\")\n\n\nname = \"Prajjwal Panday,  \"\naddress = \"Worcester, MA\"\nprint(name + address)\n\n\n\n\nPlease finish these five questions.\nQ1. Print the sum of 7 and 10 and add the comment ‘Addition’\nQ2. Create variables for each and solve the following using operators. Print out the final result as a separate variable.\n\n6 + 4\n((27 * 2) + 46) ** 0.5\n\nQ3. Using your own height (in meters) and weight (kilograms), please compute your individual BMIs. Create a variable called BMI to store the output. BMI is calculated as weight / (height)^2 where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.\nQ4. Print your name and address as strings in different variables and print them together using print() function\nQ5. Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it’s 100 x 1.1 dollars, and after two years it’s 100 X 1.1. X 1.1. Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 10 years, and print the result."

Create a Python environment in your project\nIt is recommended that you use one virtual environment per project, similar to how packrat is used to manage R packages within a project. Navigate into your RStudio project directory by using the following command:\ncd <project-dir>\nCreate a new virtual environment in a folder called my_env within your project directory using the following command:\nvirtualenv quarto_env\n\n\nStep 3. Activate your Python environment\nYou can activate the virtualenv in your project using the following command in a terminal:\nsource my_env/bin/activate\nYou can verify that you have activated the correct version of Python using the following command in a terminal:\nwhich python\n\n\nStep 4. Install Python packages in your environment\nYou can install Python packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and other packages in your Python virtualenv by using pip install using the following command in a terminal:\npip install numpy pandas matplotlib\n\npip install jupyter\n\n\nStep 5. Install and configure reticulate to use your Python version\nInstall and configure reticulate to use your Python version\ninstall.packages(\"reticulate\")\nTo configure reticulate to point to the Python executable in your virtualenv, create a file in your project directory called .Renviron with the following contents:\nRETICULATE_PYTHON=quarto_env/bin/python\nYou’ll need to restart your R session for the setting to take effect. You can verify that reticulate is configured for the correct version of Python using the following command in your R console:\nreticulate::py_config()\n\n\nStep 6.
